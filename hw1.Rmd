## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
what didn't work:
letters(1:5)
"letters" is a built in vector rather than a function.
```{r create_tibble}
rand10_greaterthan2_letters_factor_tibl <- tibble::tibble( ten_random_0_to_5 = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max=5),
logical_greater_than_two = ten_random_0_to_5 > 2,
first_ten_letters = letters[ 1:10 ],
greater_than_two_factor= as.factor(logical_greater_than_two)

)
```

```{r means}
#taking the mean of every column won't work because you can't take the mean of a nonnumeric column.
 tibl_means <- sapply( rand10_greaterthan2_letters_factor_tibl,mean)
 #putting in a check to determine if it's numeric.
 tibl_means <- sapply( rand10_greaterthan2_letters_factor_tibl,
                      function(x) if( 
                        is.numeric(x) ) {
                        return(
                          mean(x) 
                                ) } else {
                          return("Incompatible type for mean")
                        }
                      )
 
```
Converting the logical, character, and factor columns to numeric:
```{r,eval=F}
 tibl_as_num <- sapply( rand10_greaterthan2_letters_factor_tibl,
                      function(x) if( 
                        is.logical(x) |
                        is.character(x) | 
                        is.factor(x) ) {
                        return(
                        as.numeric(x) )
                        } else {
                          return(NULL)
                        }
                      )


```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
